# Overview

This is a simple game using pygame. It's a game where you're controlling a car and trying to dodge other cars on the road as you're driving past. You control it with your arrow keys and the longer you're alive, the higher your score. 

The purpose of writing this software was to practice using pygame to create a game that could be used for fun.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the game being played and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Future Work

There are a couple of things that I want to improve on in the future for this program.
* Learn how to make the background move seamlessly so it actually seems like you're driving.
* Add a car selection screen.
* Create a difficulty selection that has preset settings to make the game easier/harder.
